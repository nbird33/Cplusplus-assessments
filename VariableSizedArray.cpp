/*
Consider an -element array, , where each index  in the array contains a reference to an array of  integers (where the value of  varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given , you must answer  queries. Each query is in the format i j, where  denotes an index in array  and  denotes an index in the array located at . For each query, find and print the value of element  in the array at location  on a new line.
.

Input Format:
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i] .
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array a ) and  (an index in the array referenced by a[i] ) for a query.

Constraints:
All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 

Output Format:
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i] . There should be a total of q lines of output.

Sample Input:
2 2
3 1 5 4

0 1
1 3

Sample Output:
